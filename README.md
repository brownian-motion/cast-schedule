A tool to send my daily schedule and mic status to a nearby Chromecast

## GOALS
[x] Be able to pick from nearby Chromecasts

[ ] fetch my schedule from Google Calendar, and display it on the chromecast
[ ] display the time
[ ] Detect if my mic is active or not, and display it on the chromecast
[ ] Detect if I should be in a meeting right now, and display that on the chromecast

### Stretch goals
[ ] Remember the last deviced used
[ ] Handle OAuth login for Google Calendar, using a QR code or some sort of auto-popup
[ ] Remember those tokens from session to session
